VARIABLE
1. What is variable?
    •	Variable is a name of storage location or it is a container where we store the data.
    •	Usually there are two types of variable Local and Global 
    •	There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers). Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign
    •	4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
            o	Using var
            o	Using let
            o	Using const
            o	Using nothing


2. What is Difference between LocalScope, BlockScope and GlobleScope?
        •	Depending on the place where the variable is defined we can access the variable in program.
        •	Just because we created variable in one place in our program does not mean that it will get accessed at any place in the program.
        •	The Scope of variable defines its accessibility

LocalScope:
        •   If Variable defines inside he function then it have local scope, it can be accessed inside the function only.


Global-Scope
        •	Variable declaired outside the Function () have global Scope 
        •	Variable declaired with let, var, char outside function are quite similler
        •	Once we define it will get access anywhere in the code 
        We use Var for this
            Eg
            var x = 5;
            var y = 6;
            var z = x + y;

Block
        •	Before ES6 JavaScript had only global scope and Functional Scope 
        •	But ES6 introduced two important keyword Let and Const 
        •	These two var provides block scope
        •	i.e variable can be accessed in immediate block 
        •	This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block.



3. What is Difference Between var, let, const with example?
Var:
        •	If we define Var the variable is ccessible anywhere in the code with functional scope
        •	This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block.
        •	For a repetitive input/data usage In code we use Var
        •	It can update and redeclaired

        Eg Var pass=45154
        Console.log(pass) ----------------for Prasad it accept
        Console.log(pass)-----------------for Utkarsh also it will accept

	
Let:
        •	If we define it gives block level scope
        •	It can be updated but cannot be redeclared into the scope.
        •	If we need some unique data which not to be get repetitively and similar we use Let

        Eg 
        Let pass=46554
        Console.log(pass) ----------------for Prasad it accept
        Console.log(pass)-----------------for Utkarsh it will not accept

Const:
        •	It is having a block level scope 
        •	Can not be reinitialized or redeclaired

            Eg con n1=90

            If we go to redeclaire number it will not accept

            Con n2=81-------------------Throws an errror
